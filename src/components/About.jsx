        <div className="text-gray-600 text-justify">My curiosity has now laser-focused on one dynamic area: Web Development, specifically Front-End. To me, coding isn't just about syntax; it's about crafting visual experiences that users enjoy. Right now, I'm diving deep into JavaScript to bring static pages to life. My goal is simple: to build websites that are not only functional but also beautiful and interactive. This journey has only just begun, but I'm excited to keep learning and turning creative designs into reality.</div>
